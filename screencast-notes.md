DELIVERING THE GOODS:

* Talked about optimizing page-load overall with a heavy focus on optimizing TCP connections

* Gave a great overview of Webpage Test's Speed Index

* best ways to reduce latency

* Where I first heard about criical CSS

* The catch with inline critical CSS is that it doesn't cache since it's in the HTML page.
