# CSS BUILD PROCESS TUTORIAL

This is the source code for a demo post/screencast/blog post/whatever about my personal CSS build process. It's based on a code refactor I had to do for work and I used it as a test project for my process.

I may or may not do a tutorial for all this...there's some cool stuff in here and the code isn't complicated, but it is very detailed. Maybe too detailed for a straight-forward tutorial.

Maybe into separate tutorials...I dunno.

But everything's under an MIT license so feel free to use it as you see fit. [Tweet me](http://twitter.com/kaidez) if you have questions.

## HOW THE CODE WORKS
The production-code is in `build`. Run it by either opening `index.html` in a web browser or running the the code from the server of your choice.


## TODO

* Create "components.less" to hold any reusable components I create.
